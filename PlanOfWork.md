# Project Title

**Description**   
In three to five sentences describe the project, sponsor, and relevant information about the summer internship you will be working on. Be sure to include a sentence about the key stakeholders that will be served. 

**Goals**     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?

- Goal 1
- Goal 2

**Deliverables**    
What will this project produce? This should include items like reports, best practices, software, data, metadata schemas, models or figures, and documentation. See the two types of deliverables below: 

*Interim*     
- Deliverables that will be completed throughout the project

*End of project*
- A Final deliverable that will be completed at the end of the project (Many interim deliverables will likely add up to a final deliverable)


**Plan for Sustainability**       
Describe how you will manage deliverables during the project and the plan for handing over, and sustaining deliverables over time. We require that all internships create open documentation and update their plans for sustainability regularly.

**Milestones**    
Create a general timeline for completing each of the deliverables that you listed above. After you have settled on a timeline with feedback from your mentor, you should enter these as `Milestones` in Github's `Issues` tracker. Each task that you perform or plan to perform can then be files as an issue that is attached to a specific milestone.
