Instructions for creating a new internship repository:

1. Clone this repository
2. Modify the `readme.md` to include a brief description of the project including a link to its sponsors.
3. Add issues for the intern (or candidate) to complete.


The issues that each candidate should complete are as follows

- Read the `Mentorship Agreement`
- Read the `Plan of Work` document
- List their dates of availability (including their start date and any known (or potential) dates of conflict)
- Create a `Project Interest Document` with the following instructions:

"First, fork this repository.
Create a markdown document that describes:

- Your background (2-3 sentences).
- Why you are interested in this position (3-5 sentences).
- Two resources that you think will be helpful for this project (and a brief explanation why)
- Two questions you want to ask your mentor.

Then send me a pull request when you have added this file to the Master branch."
