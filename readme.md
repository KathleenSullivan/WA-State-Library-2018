Instructions for creating a new internship repository:

1. Clone this repository
2. Modify the `readme.md` to include a brief description of the project including a link to the intern, sponsors, etc. (The actual project description can change over time - this is just a placeholder). 
3. Add issues for the intern (or candidate) to complete. This should include deadlines for what must be accomplished BEFORE the internship begigs (see below). 


The issues that each intern should complete are as follows

- Read the `Mentorship Agreement` and agree to the terms. (You agree to the terms by repsonding to the issue) 
- Read the `Plan of Work` document and begin working with your mentor to complete this document. The document must be complete 2 weeks in advance of beginning your internship. 
- List dates of availability (including their start date and any known (or potential) dates of conflict)
